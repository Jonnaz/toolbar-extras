"When I was building a lot of sites over the last ten years I had the need "
"for a Toolbar helper plugin where all essential links would be easily "
"accessible and there when I need them. So, I built this plugin to scratch my "
"own itch. The first code was written in 2012 and relased as %1$s. That "
"plugin matured during the next two years and was used on all my install as a "
"foundation. In 2017 I discovered the Elementor Page Builder and immediately "
"fell in love with this tool. Over the months it was more than clear I needed "
"to update or completely rebuild my favorite plugin to work perfectly with my "
"Elementor site building process. Of course, I opted for the latter way. So, "
"based on that proven foundation %2$s was born in February and March of 2018 "
"after lots of coding days, sleepless nights and way too much coffee. All my "
"passion and my experience went into it to make an awesome little helper tool "
"for us Site Builders out there. I hope you find it as useful and like it as "
"much as I do. Happy site building, yeah!"
