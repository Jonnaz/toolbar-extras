"When I was building a lot of sites over the last ten years I had the need "
"for a little Toolbar helper plugin where all essential links would be easily "
"accessible and there when I need them. So, I built this plugin to scratch my "
"own itch. The first code was written in 2012 and relased as %1$s. In 2017 I "
"discovered the Elementor Page Builder and fell in love with this tool. Over "
"the months it was more than clear I needed to update or completely rebuild "
"my little plugin to work perfectly with my Elementor suite building process. "
"Of course, I opted for the latter way. So, based on a proven foundation %2$s "
"was born in February and March of 2018 after lots of coding days, sleepless "
"nights and way too much coffee. All my passion and my experience went into "
"it to make an awesome little helper tool for us Site Builders out there. I "
"hope you find it as useful and like it as much as I do. Happy site building, "
"yeah!"
